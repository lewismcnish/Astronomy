abstract = "{The introductory chapter addresses misconceptions about gravity, such as the idea that there is no gravity in space. The text explains why we donâ€™t actually feel gravity. It describes the fact that all objects fall with the same gravitational acceleration, as can be seen when objects are dropped in a vacuum. This was demonstrated by Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott who dropped a hammer and a feather onto the surface of the Moon. The text discusses Einsteinâ€™s equivalence principle and explains why astronauts feel weightless when in orbit. The chapter closes by imagining what we would feel if we were close to an extremely dense object such as a black hole. We would then feel the stretching effects of gravity, which is known as tidal gravity, as it is key to Newtonâ€™s explanation of the tides.}",
