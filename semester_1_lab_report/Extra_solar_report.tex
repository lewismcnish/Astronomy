\section*{Introduction and Background}

\section*{Aims}
Understand the effect of Doppler shifts on the intensity of stellar spectra and use the Python scipy.optimize library to determine “best-fit” radial velocities from high- resolution spectra observed at different epochs
Derive a radial velocity curve i.e. radial velocity as a function of orbital phase for each star, and use fitting to estimate the amplitude of each curve 
Estimate the mass and semi-major axis of each planet.$^1$

\section*{Method}
For the Doppler Wobble method it was first necessary to 
import all the data provided into a directory that could be 
accessed by the code source files. From here it was possible to start
writing the Python script that would take the data and produce the required outputs as outlined in the aims above.




\section*{Results}
For doppler wobble method 1.1 result is graph. \par
1.2 radial velocity of both stars on all dates\par
1.3 plot radial velocity as a function of time, calculate the phase
of each star and plot the radial velocity as a function of phase\par
1.4 calculate values of v$_{mean}$ v$_{s}$ and $\phi_{max}$ and determine errors,
for both stars\par
1.5 calculate the mass of each planet and the semi-major axis of each planet with errors\par

\section*{Aims}

Obtain a phase-folded photometric light curve for a star with a transiting planetary companion. Use this to estimate the radius and orbital semi-major axis of the planet
Apply the method of least-squares to estimate mean apparent magnitudes during the transit and non-transit phase. Hence estimate the radius of the planet.$^1$
